/**
 * Controller for Codex's experimental thread realtime (voice) sessions: protocol v3, audio output,
 * WebRTC transport — the one combination verified against a real app-server (0.160.1). It lives next
 * to a `CodexSession` on the same app-server peer but is independent of the turn lifecycle: turns
 * may start and finish while a realtime session is up, and stopping voice never touches turns.
 *
 * The host owns the process and wires three entry points to its existing peer:
 * `handleNotification` (route `thread/realtime/*`), `handleClosed` (peer exit) and a transport
 * (see `peerTransport`). Nothing else of the peer is exposed through this class: there is no
 * generic RPC passthrough.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 * - Authentication is re-checked with `account/read` on every start; an API-key login is refused,
 *   never fallen back to.
 * - State is attached before the start RPC leaves, so notifications that race the acknowledgement
 *   (early error, SDP, closed) are handled; an acknowledgement is resolved to the host, but it is
 *   not "connected" — audio connectivity is the browser's peer connection, out of scope.
 * - One instance is one use: a settled (or disposed) instance refuses to start again. Native
 *   realtime notifications carry only the thread id — no session or generation marker the client
 *   could filter by — so a late `closed`/SDP of an earlier session on the same thread cannot
 *   always be told apart from the next session's events, and no local counter changes that.
 * - What IS guaranteed per instance: only notifications arriving between this session's own start
 *   RPC and its settlement are processed. Other threads, anything before the start RPC was
 *   written, and anything after settling are dropped. Across sessions on the same thread,
 *   isolation is only as good as the thread id: the stopping phase consumes the trailing
 *   `closed` (bounded by closeTimeoutMs), so a fresh instance on the same thread is safe after a
 *   clean close; after an unclean one (close timeout, crash), the host must hand the next session
 *   a fresh native thread, where the different thread id filters the leftovers outright.
 * - Failures surface as classification tokens only. SDP and transcripts are forwarded to the host
 *   and never stored in state; raw upstream messages and credentials are neither kept nor logged.
 *
 * For chat-while-working: the whole lifecycle speaks exactly three native requests —
 * `account/read`, `thread/realtime/start`, `thread/realtime/stop` — so starting voice waits only
 * for the control handshake, never for background tasks; transcripts are forwarded as signals and
 * never re-prompted (any delegation is the host's separate decision); and stop never touches
 * turn/interrupt, so background work keeps running under its own authorization. Task identity,
 * async results and continuous chat are the coordinator's to integrate; nothing here claims that
 * native delegation itself has been verified.
