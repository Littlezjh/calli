/**
 * DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`), through the ACP server its own CLI ships: `dsh --profile acp` speaks
 * standard ACP v1 over stdio and persists every session on the agent side. The protocol handling
 * lives in acp.ts; what is dsh-specific:
 *
 * - bringing a conversation back goes through `session/resume`, not `session/load`: the agent
 *   keeps its log to itself and never replays it, so the hub's own event log is the thread's
 *   history;
 * - there are no session modes at all: no permission levels and no plan mode. Risky actions still
 *   arrive as `session/request_permission`, with one-shot allow/reject options only;
 * - the model list is grouped by provider, and every option's value is an opaque route id
 *   (`["provider","model"]`) the agent validates itself, so it is stored and sent back as-is;
 * - reasoning effort is a `reasoning_effort` option that only models with a reasoning setting
 *   declare; models without one have no effort picker.
